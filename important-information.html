	<h1>Important information for the user</h1>
	<p>As of the date, 30th of April of 2020, this tool is still on a beta stage where it will most likely commit mistakes on certain occasions.<br>
	If you use it, please do verify on your own afterwards to make sure it adapts correctly to your use and, if possible, try finding a way to break the tool<br>
	and report bugs to julian.laurito@wundermanthompson.com so we can continue to work on improving it.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Please do have in mind:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>For now, multi-testing is not available as we are making improvements on it. It will look like it's working but it isn't. It will not be able to ID which error belongs to which file.</li>
	<li>The criteria of special characters has the apostrophe, therefore if you have one in the HTML structure, it will most likely pop up as an error. Dismiss that case.</li>
	<li>So far the criteria is based on what we've experienced and encountered while testing e-mails. If you find a character to be wrongfully added, please let us know.</li>
	<li>We want to improve every day! So please any other type of feedback will be welcomed!</li>
	</ul>
